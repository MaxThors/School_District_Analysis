# School_District_Analysis

## Overview of Project
The overall purpose of this project was to look at how removing the 9th grade math and reading scores from the students at Thomas High
School affected the school district analysis. We first did the analysis with the 9th grade scores and then after. We used Pandas library
and data frames to complete the analysis.

## Results

### How is the district summary affected?
There are so many schools and students in the district that the district summary was barely affected. However, the passing percentages
did decrease slightly for math, reading, and overall.

### How is the school summary affected?
You can see very little changes. However, the passing percentages for Thomas High School slightly decreased by less than half of a percent
for math, reading, and overall.

### How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?
Thomas High School was second highest percentage of passing students both before and after removing the ninth graders.

### How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:

#### Math and Reading Scores by Grade
This does not affect the math and reading scores by grade very much.

#### Scores by School Spending
Again, this is not affect by nearly as much as other categories. 

#### Scores by School Size
Still, no change.

#### Score by School Type
No change from before and after removing the ninth graders scores.

## Summary

### First Change
The first change I noticed was the slight change in math, reading, and overall scores for Thomas High School.

### Second Change
The second change I noted was that that overall math and reading pass percentage decreased from 74.98% and 85.81% to 74.76% and 85.66%,
respectively.

### Third Change
The average math scores decreased from 83.42 to 83.35. However, the average reading score actually did increase from 83.85 to 83.89.

### Fourth Change
The last change I noticed was is that Thomas High School is now much closer to being passes by the rest of the schools for the second
highest passing rate.
